After graduating with a Mastersâ€™ degree in Applied Physics, I started my experience at National Instruments and led me to R&D software developer where implement new tools in LabVIEW drivers.

I joined Fluigent where I had the opportunity establish a complete software development quality process and implement engineering tools, lead several product releases, manage innovation (financing and IP aspects) within highly international teams.

This led to my current role, helping customers to develop software frameworks and bespoke desktop and embedded software applications.
