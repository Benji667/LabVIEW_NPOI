# NPOI assembly wrapper in LabVIEW.

This project intends to implement a wrapper of the NPOI assembly that allows MS Office files manipulation in LabVIEW (no MS Office installation required).
I'm still exploring NPOI interface for capabilities and possibilities; trying different approaches, more like a PoC. In a second time, I'll try to implement a reliable , scalable, maintainable architecture. 
Feel free to let me know if you're interested in architecture or implementation contribution, I'll be more than happy! 

##Whast is NPOI?

NPOI is a .NET version of POI Java Project. It is an open source .NET library to read and write Microsoft Office file formats formats (*.xls/xlsx, *.doc/docx, *.ppt/pptx). 
You can manually download the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/nissl-lab/npoi) or install from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NPOI/).

## Installation
* Download the latest version of the LabVIEW NPOI VI Package from the release page.
* Use VIPM to install it on your LabVIEW version (2017+).
* Download and install the latest version of the LUT package available [here](https://github.com/Benji667/LookUp_Table).

## Examples
Below is a simple example to show how to use the LabVIEW NPOI API to interact with Excel or Word document.
