# NPOI assembly wrapper in LabVIEW.

This project intends to implement a wrapper of the NPOI assembly that allows MS Office files manipulation in LabVIEW (no MS Office installation required).

## Whast is NPOI?

NPOI is a .NET version of POI Java Project. It is an open source .NET library to read and write Microsoft Office file formats formats (*.xls/xlsx, *.doc/docx, *.ppt/pptx). 
You can manually download the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/nissl-lab/npoi) or install from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NPOI/).

## Installation
